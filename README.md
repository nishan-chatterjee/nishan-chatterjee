# Hello there. I'm Nishan. üëã

I'm currently pursuing a PhD in Natural Language Processing, focusing on the nature of Political Discourse across various mediums like news, parliamentary proceedings, historical archives, social media, and surveys. I'm interested in exploring the boundaries of language and vision.

üåç **Current Location (or whenever this was last updated):** Ljubljana, Slovenia

üî≠ **Currently working on:**
- Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis with Kliping
- Automatic generation and evaluation of Debates
- Visual Dialog for Chess (Chessable Project Proposal)

üîå **Sidelined:**
- Seq2seq model for automatic timeline summarization
- Graph neural networks for Visual Dialog

üí¨ **Ask me about:**
- LLMs
- Discourse Analysis
- Visualizations

üì´ **How to reach me:**

‚ö° **Fun fact:**
I'm working on a model that can dish insults like Monty Python. Here's my favourite:
"I don't want to talk to you no more, you empty-headed animal-food-trough wiper. I fart in your general direction. Your mother was a hamster, and your father smelt of elderberries."
