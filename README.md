# Hello there. I'm Nishan. 👋

I have a Master's in Computational Linguistics, with a strong focus on Natural Language Processing (NLP), Computer Vision, Multimodality, Information Retrieval, and Interpretable AI. I'm passionate about exploring the boundaries of language and technology to leverage machine learning and deep learning techniques for language understanding and computer vision.

🌍 **Location:** Stuttgart, Germany

🔭 **Currently working on:**
- Developing a Seq2seq model for automatic timeline summarization
- Researching multimodal feature fusion via graph neural networks for Visual Dialog
- #100DaysOfCode challenge focused on Algorithms, Language and Vision, Graphs, and Visualizations, using Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and Geometric Deep Learning methods

⚡ **Fun fact:**
I'm working on a model that can dish insults like Monty Python. Here's my favorite:
"I don't want to talk to you no more, you empty-headed animal-food-trough wiper. I fart in your general direction. Your mother was a hamster, and your father smelt of elderberries."

   - Novel Multimodal Fusion Graph Framework using Implicit Relation-Awareness
   - Working on Panoptic Segmentation, caption augmentation, and Transformer based approaches
   
3. [Neural Belief Tracker - Dialog Modeling](https://github.com/acxcv/nbt.git):
	- Implementation of a Neural Belief State Tracker based on [Nikola Mrkšić and Ivan Vulić](https://aclanthology.org/P18-2018/)
	- Context Modeling of System Output with User Utterances to improve Candidate Pairs

5. [BioMedScribe](https://github.com/nishan-chatterjee/BioMedScribe):
   - Projects centered around the statistical analysis of medical data

6. [Emotion Analysis and Semantic Role Labeling](https://github.com/nishan-chatterjee/emotion-analysis):
   - Classification of Ekman's Emotions across multiple datasets using LSTM, BERT

### Experience

- System Analyst and Full-Stack Developer (Working Student) at IMS, Universität Stuttgart
- Systems Engineer Trainee (Employee) at Infosys Limited

### Hobbies
- Learning to play chess and guitar. Hopefully, I can manage to do both simultaneously soon and become unstoppable.
- Listening to audiobooks while running or cooking. Think how cool it'd be if I could parallelly play chess and some guitar.
- Also, my brain makes way too many dad jokes. Apologies in advance for this feature.
